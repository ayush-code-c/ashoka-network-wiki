# Networks Capstone Project

This crash course is designed to provide a layered overview of computer networking, breaking down complex concepts into practical, easy-to-digest sections. Each contributor focuses on a specific part of the networking stackâ€”from the physical media that carries signals, up through protocols that enable communication, all the way to security and design best practices.

The documentation is divided according to the OSI and TCP/IP models, ensuring that every layer is addressed in context. Along the way, examples, diagrams, and real-world analogies are included to make abstract ideas more concrete.

By the end, readers will have a holistic understanding of how networks function, how data moves across systems, and how to design stable, secure environments.
